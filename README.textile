h2. Additional Reading
On how to setup hostapd by yourself, read my guide at http://nims11.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/hostapd-the-linux-way-to-create-virtual-wifi-access-point/
It will also help in way to understand the source code of my script better.

h2. Contribute
Feel free to fork and commit changes to the code. There is a lot of scope for improvement.
I have only tested this script well enough with ath9k wifi driver under Arch Linux. Help me improve it through bug reports, or even confirmed working report with the environment under which it occured.
